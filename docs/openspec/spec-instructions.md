<project_context>
<!-- This is background information for you. Do NOT include this in your output. -->
Monorepo: TypeScript, React 19 + React Router v7, Hono + SQLite (better-sqlite3)
Apps: client-time (time tracking), client-watch (movies/TV), client-food (dining); backend in src/
UI: Tailwind CSS 4, dark-only, mobile-first; fixed bottom nav; safe areas via --sat/--sab CSS vars
Data: timestamps as ISO 8601 UTC; tags as bare lowercase comma-separated; repository pattern (interfaces + SQLite impls)
Deploy: each new client app requires updates to Caddyfile, Caddyfile.local, server-deploy.sh, dev-local.sh
</project_context>

<rules>
<!-- These are constraints for you to follow. Do NOT include this in your output. -->
- Add **App**: <name> to each spec; use "all" for cross-cutting specs
</rules>

<instruction>
Create specification files that define WHAT the system should do.

Create one spec file per capability listed in the proposal's Capabilities section.
- New capabilities: use the exact kebab-case name from the proposal (specs/<capability>/spec.md).
- Modified capabilities: use the existing spec folder name from openspec/specs/<capability>/ when creating the delta spec at specs/<capability>/spec.md.

Delta operations (use ## headers):
- **ADDED Requirements**: New capabilities
- **MODIFIED Requirements**: Changed behavior - MUST include full updated content
- **REMOVED Requirements**: Deprecated features - MUST include **Reason** and **Migration**
- **RENAMED Requirements**: Name changes only - use FROM:/TO: format

Format requirements:
- Each requirement: `### Requirement: <name>` followed by description
- Use SHALL/MUST for normative requirements (avoid should/may)
- Each scenario: `#### Scenario: <name>` with WHEN/THEN format
- **CRITICAL**: Scenarios MUST use exactly 4 hashtags (`####`). Using 3 hashtags or bullets will fail silently.
- Every requirement MUST have at least one scenario.

MODIFIED requirements workflow:
1. Locate the existing requirement in openspec/specs/<capability>/spec.md
2. Copy the ENTIRE requirement block (from `### Requirement:` through all scenarios)
3. Paste under `## MODIFIED Requirements` and edit to reflect new behavior
4. Ensure header text matches exactly (whitespace-insensitive)

Common pitfall: Using MODIFIED with partial content loses detail at archive time.
If adding new concerns without changing existing behavior, use ADDED instead.

Example:
```
## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: User can export data
The system SHALL allow users to export their data in CSV format.

#### Scenario: Successful export
- **WHEN** user clicks "Export" button
- **THEN** system downloads a CSV file with all user data

## REMOVED Requirements

### Requirement: Legacy export
**Reason**: Replaced by new export system
**Migration**: Use new export endpoint at /api/v2/export
```

Specs should be testable - each scenario is a potential test case.
