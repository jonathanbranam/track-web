# Phase 07 — track-web engineer skill: scenario → OpenSpec change


**Repo:** `track-web`
**Depends on:** phase 02 (this repo, hard); harness repo's phase 06
(recommended — see note below)
**Blocks:** phase 08a (this repo)

**Status:** ✅ **Complete** — archived OpenSpec change `2026-08-16-dungeon-tactics-engineer-skill`
(skill `.claude/skills/scenario-to-change/`).
**Disposition:** **DELETE.** It converts a harness handoff bundle that will no longer be produced.

## Goal

The skill described in the proposal: used by the engineer, within Claude
Code, in track-web, to turn a signed-off scenario handoff (`.feature` files
+ changeset + implementation notes, from the harness's workspace) into a
proper OpenSpec change.

**On the "recommended" dependency on harness repo's phase 06:** this skill
can be drafted directly against the artifact shapes already fixed in the
proposal (`.feature` + changeset + implementation notes) without phase 06's
code existing yet. But verifying it end-to-end needs a real handoff bundle,
which only phase 06 produces — sequence this after 06 unless there's a
specific reason to parallelize the drafting.

## Decision carried over from the proposal

Per the proposal's "Delta vs. canonical" section: the skill reads the
handoff bundle and:

1. Scaffolds an OpenSpec change (`proposal.md`/`design.md`/`tasks.md`, per
   the usual `propose-change` shape).
2. Writes the scenarios into that change's own
   `openspec/changes/<change-id>/features/` delta directory.
3. Derives the change's `specs/<capability>/spec.md` prose-requirement
   delta's `ADDED`/`MODIFIED`/`REMOVED Requirements` **directly from the
   changeset's own added/modified/removed classification** — the two
   vocabularies were deliberately kept close (proposal's "Baseline and
   changeset" section) so this is closer to a format conversion than fresh
   authoring.

This gives one OpenSpec change carrying both the human-readable requirement
delta and the literal, executable scenario delta together — the same
pattern `deck-harness-scaffold` already used for its own specs (see
`openspec/changes/archive/2026-08-15-deck-harness-scaffold/specs/
harness-auth/spec.md` for the ADDED-Requirements/Scenario format to match).

## Concrete steps

- New skill under `track-web/.claude/skills/` (e.g.
  `scenario-to-change/SKILL.md`), following this repo's own
  skill-authoring conventions (see the `skill-creator` skill).
- Input: a path to the harness's handoff bundle (copied, or pointed to
  directly, from `dungeon-harness-server/data/workspace/...` in the harness
  repo).
- Behavior:
  - Parse the changeset.
  - Draft `proposal.md`/`design.md`, using the implementation notes as
    supplementary context (e.g. surfacing suggested step consolidation as
    a design-doc callout, not silently applying it).
  - Copy the `.feature` files into the new change's `features/` delta
    directory.
  - Generate the `specs/<capability>/spec.md` delta's Requirement/Scenario
    blocks from the changeset's added/modified/removed entries.
  - Produce `tasks.md` stubs for implementing the corresponding
    `@amiceli/vitest-cucumber` step definitions.
- After the skill runs, normal `apply-change` → `archive-change` OpenSpec
  workflow takes over. `archive-change` is what actually merges
  `features/*.feature` into the canonical tree (per the proposal's merge
  point) — wire it (or a follow-up manual step, if not worth automating
  yet) to also trigger phase 04's step-catalog regeneration.

## Deliverable

Given a real handoff bundle from harness repo's phase 06, running the skill
produces a reviewable, implementable OpenSpec change with both the prose
delta and the executable Gherkin delta already in place.

## Suggested OpenSpec capability

N/A directly — this is a skill, not a spec'd runtime capability. Could
still be scoped as its own small OpenSpec change describing the skill's
expected behavior, consistent with everything else in this plan being
spec-driven, if that consistency is worth it.
